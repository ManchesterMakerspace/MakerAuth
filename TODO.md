Arduino code:
  [ ] Read wifi configuration from SPIFFS file
  [ ] Read config for what server to talk to from SPIFFS file
  [ ] Maybe read how long to be open for from file? Or from server response?

Server code:
  Make it work, lol.

Hardware:
  [ ] Update board to use better microUSB plug
  [ ] Maybe change LED header to one of the plugs used on the liquidpixels bezel cable, since those worked well.
